1. Remoed the accent on the "e" from films "Cleo from 5 to 7" and "Cache"
2. Renamed "Ballad of Narayama" to "The Ballad of Narayama"
3. Changed "Mulholland Dr." to "Mulholland Drive"

Came across another funny little case.
Ebert lists Departures as being released in 2009, but Wikipedia states 2008.
That's a hard thing to look out for.
